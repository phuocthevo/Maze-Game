# Maze-Game
This is a project for a group of 2 at UC Berkeley CS61B class.

We started this project from scratch. We created a simple maze game where the player is able to move around the maze to find a key and unlock the exit door. This maze was decorated with a few interesting things like flower, water, and instance door that can instantly move to a random place.

3. To exit without saving, press 'q'
